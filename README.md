## JavaScript Splice Method â€“ Beginner Practice Repo

This repo is for learning how the `splice()` method works in JavaScript.  
`splice()` is used to **add**, **remove**, or **replace** items in an array.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

Arrays are a big part of JavaScript.  
Knowing how to change them with `splice()` helps you build better websites and apps.  
It also makes your coding logic stronger and prepares you for other JavaScript tools and libraries.

## How to Learn from This Repo

- Read each example slowly and carefully.
- Change the numbers or values to see what happens.
- Think: What happens if I remove more items? Or add at a different place?
- Write your own small examples using `splice()` to test your understanding.


This will help you learn by doing â€” not just reading.
